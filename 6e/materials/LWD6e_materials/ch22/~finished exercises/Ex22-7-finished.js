// Exercise 22-7
// Note that there are multiple ways to approach the challenges in 
// this exercise. The examples here use console.log() after each step, 
// but you may find more efficient ways to get the same result. 

// Challenge 1 (replace "22" with your age)

let days = 22 * 365.25;
console.log("Days: ", days)

let hours = days * 24;
console.log("Hours: ", hours);

let minutes = hours * 60;
console.log("Minutes: ", minutes);

let seconds = minutes * 60;
console.log("Seconds: ", seconds);

// Challenge 2 

let $p = document.querySelectorAll("p");
console.log($p)

let count = $p.length;
console.log(count);
//returns the number of paragraphs on the page
